<i>I hate people, not because they are evil, but because each of them, they reflect a fragment of the truth about myself.</i>

-- Zephy Cris, 7th Book of Sorrow, "Unyielding Pain"

<em>December, 622 Post Astrum</em>

Zephy Cris walked into the room and stood before a young man garbed in raiments of darkest ebon, his skin pale as paraffin. His eyes were a glacial blue, colder than steel, and pierced the veils of the shadows and darkness surrounding his mysterious existence like brightest moonlight. When he spoke, it was lyrical, as though he were orchestrating a symphony of the most perfect instruments, and his words harmonized with meaning as effortlessly and organically as water turns to ice.

"Pup, would you like me to tell you the truth about this world?" He growled.

"Please do," Zephy replied.

"Humans are despicable creatures," the young man began. "I am Lord Serrellious Arclaud, Master of Darkness and Despair, and I shall be your Teacher henceforth. In other tongues, I am known also as Shamshir of Shimmering Light, and Moonwalker. I shall temper and forge you, Zephyr Cris, into a weapon of unfathomable power. In exchange, you will come to protect the peoples of this planet, and one day trade in your old name for a new one. If you betray any of these tenets, you shall be cast into hell where you shall suffer for all eternity."

"What shall my new name be?"

"That is not of importance now, Pup." Serrellious got up and walked to the edge of the room where there was a bookshelf with a single book on it. He picked up the book and walked over to Zephy and handed it to him.

"What is this?" Zephy asked, leafing through the pages of the book only to find blank emptiness inside.

"It is the Holy Quran." Serrellious replied indifferently. "I have learned, Zephy, that you were once in love with a woman by the name of Amber. Is that true?"

"Who told you that?" Zephy asked, somewhat vehemently.

"Your soul." Serrellious replied nonchalantly. "Well, is it true?"

"It... is." Zephy replied, now curious. "Master, what is it you mean when you say you conversed with my soul?"

"Something more but nothing less," Serrellious shrugged. "You will understand in due time. But tell me this: what has changed that has caused you to stop loving Amber?"

It was Zephy's turn to casually shrug in reply. "Many misbegotten creatures walk this life. I confessed my love to her openly and made only a small request of her, guaranteeing I would peacefully part ways and never speak to her again in exchange if she so desired... instead of seeing my request through, she slashed and tore at my heart needlessly like a bitch. If it is God's judgement, I hope she suffers eternally in the abyss from whence she came, but if that is not what Allah deems to be fair, I bid her no ill will and hope she walks safely along the roads of this life. Allah alone shall cast a most fair judgement upon her, and should she not repent for her crimes against herself, she alone shall suffer along with all her wretched of lot of this land, in hell, the eternal resting place of the condemned and wicked. Truth be told, I hope she repents. Her being punished would do me not an ounce of good."

Serrellious began to clap slowly. "I offer you commendation, Zephy, for such gracious words and wisdom. However, your perspective is singularly skewed and biased in favor of yourself. You did not really give Amber a choice in the matter. You attempted to force her hand, though you do not do it. Reflect upon the matter, Zephy Cris, and repent for your sins -- this is your first lesson!"

And with a flick of his cloak, Serrellious vanished into a flurry of virgin powdery snow that all at once came from everywhere and nowhere.


<em>April, 623 Post Astrum</em>

As Vesta wriggled into her sleeping bag and cozied up, Janus focused her attention on the roaring fire. She added two logs and summoned a watchful fire spirit to ensure the flames and embers wouldn’t go out so easily.

“Spirits of the Earth, please kindle these flames to give us warmth.” The fire crackled and emanated orange sparks in response to Janus’ incantation.

“Oyasuminasai, nee-chan.” Vesta said, her eyes closed and a satisfied smile across her adorable face.

“G’night.” Janus replied as she turned her attention to erecting a simple intruder barrier about their campsite.

“Those with eyes that pierce dark and light, please watch over our wearied bodies tonight.” Janus exhaled gently then took a deep breath, channeling the spell she'd just cast into a set of bells tied around her neck. If anyone or anything approached within 100 meters or so, the bells around her neck would start tinkling uncontrollably.

Content with their setup, Janus removed her cloak and then her body armor and snuggled into her own sleeping bag, falling asleep almost immediately.

***

At some point during the night, Janus woke up. Opening her eyes, she first glimpsed sight of <i>him</i>:

A young man, perhaps in his mid-twenties or even younger, sat on the makeshift logs Janus and Vesta had been using as benches. His face and hair were dark and tinged with orange from the light of the dancing flames, and Janus could make out the glowing end of a lit cigarette sitting between his lips. He seemed handsome, and Janus realized he was staring right at her.

He inhaled, removed the cigarette, exhaled a cloud of smoke downwind and away from Janus, and said warmly: “Good evening.”

“Who are you?” Janus replied coldly, slowly getting out of her sleeping bag.

The young man’s jaw seemed to shiver. “Chilly, aren’t you?” He asked in response to her coldness.

Janus scowled, extracting herself completely and standing up, all the while eyed by the shadowy and mysterious stranger. She immediately gripped her short sword.

“Feisty too, huh?”

“How’d you make it past the barrier?” Janus asked icily, feeling the bells around her neck. They definitely hadn’t rung like they were supposed to.

“Oh that? I had Meowster here help me.” The young man said, turning his head to look down towards where he pointed his thumb: a black cat Janus had failed to notice sitting beside him on the log. “He may not look it, but he’s quite the sneaky one, I’ll tell ya.”

The cat meowed amicably, as if introducing himself to Janus. <i>The cat's name isn't really Meowster, is it?</i> Janus thought to herself. <i>Whatever.</i> Being well-accustomed to the ways of the world, Janus did not let her mind get waysided so so easily. “What are you doing here?” she asked the man in an accusatory tone.

“Just enjoying some of the warmth of your fire.”

Janus clenched her teeth. She tried to sense if there were any others nearby without diverting her focus or attention from this man.

“Hey now, that’s really all it is. We’re not robbers or nothin’. Besides…” The young man gestured to Vesta as he took a drag from his cigarette. “Seeing a cutie-pie like her, I really didn’t have a choice but to watch over you two.”

“You could have left us alone.”

“No, I couldn’t. Listen Tinkerbell, it’s obvious you twos are newbs when it comes to traveling.”

Janus clenched her teeth even harder and furrowed her brows into an expression of hardened rage. She  didn’t take kindly to being called “Tinkerbell.”

“Scare-rey.” The young man said. “At the very least, you’d be safer tonight with me watching over you.” He continued, flicking the remainder of his cigarette into the fire.

<i>The gall of this guy,</i> thought Janus. Still, her expression aside, she did her best to remain polite. “Maybe. But maybe you’re just trying to gain my trust so you and your gang can kidnap us later.” Janus replied coolly, remembering tales of despicable slave-traders.

“Whoa, there’s a thought. You two are certainly hot enough to make for some fine merchandise.” Then the man started cracking up. “But that’s too funny. Me? A slave trader?” He suddenly grew serious. “I’d rather burn in the pits of hell than be scum like that.”

The genuity with which he spoke helped Janus relax just a little. She was glad he sincerely seemed to be a man of some ideals. But being familiar with the ways of the world, Janus didn’t trust appearances, and thusly did not concede too much to the words of this stranger. Whatever he said, Janus didn't intend to simply take his word for it. "Regardless, we don’t need your help. Does it look like we need your help?”

The man sighed. “Look. If I wanted to do anything, I would’ve done it ages ago, sleeping beauty. It doesn’t really accredit me to wander up into your camp to smoke a cigarette only to abduct you later, does it? I’d have to be just about the worst kidnapper kingdom come for that to be the case.”

The cat meowed in accordance. Janus had forgotten about the cat, but realized its eyes were intelligently focused directly on Janus, gleaming in the light of the still-burning fire.

“No, but it could mean you’re the best kidnapper ever.”

The man groaned. “Seriously? What’s that even supposed to mean?”

Janus rolled her eyes, somehow perturbed he didn’t get her line of reasoning. “It means, maybe you’re the sort of kidnapper who earns people’s trust and travels with them then ganks them singlehandedly at the very end -- saving you the need for a gang and allowing you to reap the spoils of slave-trade all by yourself.”

In response the man turned to the cat. “Sounds like the princess here has read herself a lot of stories, huh meowster?”
In response the cat meowed loudly and purred.

Janus could feel her fists clenching.

“I bet she probably scared off all the sweet guys, huh?” He continued.

The cat meowed again in apparent agreement.

Janus wanted to strangle this guy and then grab his cat by the tail and beat him over the head with the furball. <i>Meow to that, cat!</i> She thought. She felt only slightly ashamed about being so okay with animal cruelty. She loved cats, but she hated this guy enough that she hated anything associated with him, even if it was a cute and furry animal.

“I swear to god… if you don’t leave…” Janus began, her blood boiling.

At that point, Vesta suddenly sat up, her eyes half-closed and an expression of dazed grogginess plastered across her cute face. She yawned audibly, and just as it seemed like she was done yawning her yawn morphed into another yawn.

Some part of Janus' brain thought: <i>Oh! The secret Gargantua-yawn technique! </i>Some other part of her mind then immediately thought: <i>Damnit! What am I thinking at a time like this?!</i>

"That was pretty impressive, cutie-pie." Said the man.

<i>And what is he doing calling her a cutie-pie?!</i>

Vesta turned to look at the stranger.

"Umm... Danish, whosh dish man..." She yawned another teensy yawn.

<i>So adorable!</i> Janus couldn't help but think. <i>Vesta's undeniably lovable 'I just woke up from sleep' accent! </i>Vesta, for whatever reason, always spoke like that right after she'd woken up. When she did so, she resorted to her childhood nickname for Janus: Danish.

"I'm her new boyfriend." The man answered, beaming at Vesta.

Janus' mouth just hung open.

Vesta also just sat there, still groggy.

Finally Janus became unfrozen and responded. If it had been bright out, everyone would have seen her blushing. "I... am not!"

Vesta yawned again. "Oh... 'kay..." she replied, apparently too out of it to show interest in what the stranger had just said. "Danish, I hafta... go..." Vesta started getting out of her sleeping bag.

Janus understood what Vesta meant and helped her little sister out of the sleeping bag. Vesta was always too scared to use the restroom alone in the dark... even back home, Janus would always walk her sister to the bathroom and stand outside the hallway when her sister had to go in the middle of the night. She'd gotten used to it since the two of them had always slept in the same bed since Vesta was very young, but there were more than a few times Janus had wished Vesta would mature a bit and at least be able to go by herself at night. Especially now. <i>I really don't want to take my eyes off this guy...</i> Janus thought to herself.

"You. Don't do anything shady." Janus said, scowling at the man.

"Heh. Like what?"

"Like... peeking." The words escaped Janus' mouth before she could help it.

"So now I'm reduced from slave-trader scum to pervert?"

"Yes. Maybe. You're still scum, either way."

The man shrugged. "No helping it, I guess. Such is the fate of the male subspecies."

Janus took Vesta's hand and led her a little farther out than usual, turning back ever so often to make sure the man wasn't following. He seemed to occupy himself with petting his cat, but Janus didn't trust him. <i>I bet everything I've seen so far is just a facade... a big ruse to try and earn my trust.</i>

They stopped a fair distance off where Janus was certain the stranger couldn't see them anymore, and Janus turned around as Vesta did her business.

When they got back to the fire, they found the stranger had procured a small metal ball that he was tossing up and catching to occupy himself. <i>He's like a little kid...</i> Janus thought to herself. She wanted to knock the ball out of its trajectory in midair. She didn't know why she wanted to be mean to him... but something about that guy just pissed her off.

Now more awake, it was then that Vespa first noticed the cat. "Ooh! A cat!" Vespa immediately ran up and sat next to the cat, who looked agreeably up at Vesta and meowed.

"Oh he's just adorable! Can I pet him, Mister Boyfriend?"

The man stopped tossing his ball around and smiled at Vesta. "Sure can! His name's Meowster."

<i>Oh... so the cat's name really is Meowster...</i> Janus affirmed to herself. <i>Wait a second...</i>

"HEY!" Janus yelled. "He is NOT my boyfriend!"

"You're so cute, Mister Meowster!" Vesta said, oblivious to Janus' outburst. She scratched simultaneously around both sides of Meowster's jaws, and Meowster purred agreeably with his eyes closed in an expression of genuine feline felicity.

<i>It's no use... </i>Vesta had clearly taken a liking to the man. And the cat. Janus was never going to hear the end about her "boyfriend" now. <i>It's almost like... Vespa controls my love life.</i> Janus bent her head down and sobbed quietly. <i>How did it come to this... </i>She thought as she cried, resigning herself to being paired with this... <i>boy</i>.

"What's wrong, Ice-Queen?" The young man grinned mischievously. "Get it? It sounds like ice-cream, which is sweet, but cold--"

"I GET IT YOU DORK." Janus yelled.

"...just like you." He finished, unphased by Janus' outburst.

"So what's your name, Mister?" Vespa asked.

<i>Oh, that's right, I never asked...</i> Janus realized.

"Zephy Cris." He smiled. "And you are?"

"Vespa Anelise."

"Then that would make your sister..."

"Janus Anelise." Janus spoke up before Zephy could finish.

"Oh. So your name <i>isn't</i> Danish." Zephy mocked.

"Of course it isn't Danish. What kind of name is Zephy, anyways?" Janus replied contemptfully.

Zephy shrugged. "You can just call me Cris if that suits you better." He said in a nonchalant tone.

"It's like you have two first names to make up for the fact your actual first name is so weird." Janus continued venomously.

Vespa was just watching this fluid back-and-forth between Janus and Zephy, all the while petting Meowster who had taken to Vespa's lap.

Zephy just smiled at that. "I think Janus is a pretty name by the way. The God of new beginnings and transitions, right?"

Janus stared into the fire, feeling her face grow hot, though she wasn't sure if it was from the fire or from blood rushing to her head. "Yeah... thanks, I guess." She said, for the first time unsure how to respond.

"I was beginning to think you weren't capable of saying anything without trying to skewer me with your words."

"Only because most of the things you say are so asinine."

He grinned. "So is that your way of accepting my protective services?"

Janus rolled her eyes. "In your dreams. The only thing we'd need protection from is men like you."

Vespa looked up. "Come on sis, it'll be fun! Right Meowster?"

Meowster lifted his head and meowed happily, then closed his eyes and returned to purring contentedly on Vespa's lap.

"Vespa... I really don't think so."

"Aw." Zephy said, hurt. "Oh well. I can understand where you're coming from. I'll be on my way then."

"Wait, you're going to travel at night?"

"Well seeing in the dark isn't really an issue for me and Meowster here. Plus, that way we can get to our destination faster."

"I see." Janus said. "Well, good luck I guess."

"Yeah. Thanks." Zephy got up, and Meowster intelligently followed suit, jumping down to the ground from Vespa's lap and then leaping onto Zephy's shoulder. "I'll be seeing you, cutie-pie," Zephy said to Vespa.

"Bye Mister Boyfriend."

Janus sighed, only slightly irked. Then, as Zephy began to walk into the darkness, all the bells around Janus' neck began ringing like crazy.

<i>Something on the perimeter... and it's big! </i>Janus thought, immediately looking all around and trying to pinpoint the intruder. But she couldn't, it seemed as though... <i>multiple intruders!</i> She realized.

Zephy immediately darted back, pulling Vespa between him and Janus. Vespa clung to Janus' back, frightened. Realizing she didn't have her body armor on, Janus pulled herself away for a moment, just as something whizzed past her in the darkness of the night. <i>What, arrows? ... No, not big enough. Darts? Spines?</i>

“There!” Janus heard Zephy cry. There was the flash of bright light illuminating the entire campsite and most particularly Zephy’s face -- a macabre and scarred visage that sent shivers down Janus’ spine -- and then the clanging of steel against steel against the backdrop of blinding darkness.

Then silence. Janus was disoriented, but she could make out the faint whimpering of Vespa. She didn’t know where Zephy or his pet cat were.

Then she heard mews.

“I’m okay, Meowster,” Came Zephy’s reassuring voice. “The bastard just got my eyes, but I can still see.”

In the darkness, Janus had no idea of telling what was going on. “Zephy!” She called out. “Zephy, is everything all right?”

“Yeah, that monster's dead. Don’t worry about me, I’m okay, just tend to Vespa, okay?”

“Got it.” Janus replied, still somewhat blinded and trying to sense out Vespa’s location. <i>There</i>. she thought, feeling the presence of her little sister. “Vespa, you okay?” Janus asked after crawling her way to Vespa’s location and wrapping her arms about Vespa’s shoulders.

Janus could feel Vespa’s body as she nodded, and relief gradually overtook her panicked nerves as she regained her vision. She continued holding onto Vespa.

“Damnit…” She heard Zephy curse. <i>What on earth was all that?</i> Janus wondered, still somewhat anxious.

"A Night Shiver." Zephy said, as if able to read Janus' mind.  Janus, now able to make out Zephy from the light of the fire, looked towards him as he continued to speak.

"They seek human targets at night that are unable to fend for themselves. They have the ability of concealing their aura, which is why you weren't able to pinpoint their location so easily. They paralyze their prey with poisonous darts tipped with a corrosive kind of acid -- agh," Zephy grunted. "Some of the acid got into my eyes when I cut the beast."

"Will you be okay?" Janus asked, concerned.

"Maybe. Most likely, I won't be able to see for a long time."

Janus suddenly grew very worried. "You're not... permanently blind, are you?"

"I could be. I don't think there have been many recorded cases of Night Shiver acid getting into people's eyes or the medical effects of such, so we'll have to wait it out and see."

"Does it hurt?"

Zephy didn't answer right away. "Nah. It just itches a little, that's all. I've already bandaged my eyes with a rag. I'll be fine. You just tend to Vespa."

"What about Meowster?"

"He's here, licking my hand. Little bugger won't lay off me for a sec. He'll be okay."

Janus smiled in the dark.

"Say... Zephy. That... bright light..."

"Yeah?"

"What was that?"

"My soul edge."

Janus thought for a moment. <em>No way...? </em><em>This guy... can perform a technique like that?</em> In all the land, few people were able to command mastery of weapons materialization from pure magical energy. The sheer amount of latent concentration and ability required were... off the charts. And Zephy was so young. Usually, only really old people who had poured their life into Taijutsu and had forged their focus through relentless training to take on a form harder and sharper than steel were able to summon a soul edge... and here was a young guy who out of nowhere was able to do something like that.

"Don't believe me? Just watch." Zephy said, again seemingly able to read Janus' mind. There was a bright flash that temporarily blinded Janus, only this time, the light did not disappear. In the dark, Janus could make out the glow emanating from a bright sword Zephy held in his hand. It glowed a pure white, like the light of the moon on a clear night.

"Want to know the name of my blade?" Zephy asked.

"Sure..." Janus replied, curious.

"Lux Tenebris."

"What does that mean?"

"Dark Light. It is the light born from darkness... to protect the souls of this world from evil."

The light from Lux Tenebris vanished as Zephy put it out. "That Night Shiver didn't stand a chance. I'd been tracking it down with Meowster on instructions from the Magistrate of the City of Golden Fire when I stumbled upon you two."

"So... you're a bounty hunter?"

"Heh. Something like that. But hunting the Night Shiver wasn't my only task." Zephy began, then paused, as if waiting for Janus to say something. Janus remained quiet.

"I was also instructed to retrieve two runaway sisters.... Princess Anjelique and Princess Amber, heirs to the frozen throne of Arendelle, the renowned maidens of frost and former ice queens." Zephy grinned, no doubt in fond memory of his pun from earlier that evening. "You wouldn't have happened to stumble across any girls by those names, would you?"

Goosebumps started down Janus' spine as she heard the names her parents had originally given her and Vespa. Vespa didn't know, she'd been too young when their parents had passed on to remember her name given by birthright, but the two of them were really princesses to the heir of the City of Golden Fire... the two Frozen Princesses.

"No..." Janus said, lying.

"A&amp;A..." Zephy replied.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just, both their names begin with A. I was thinking of writing a book titled 'A&amp;A' about the adventures of those two sisters. But it's a stupid title." Zephy replied. Janus saw the light and sparks from a lighter and then saw the glowing ember of a lit cigarette floating in midair.

"Janus, there's something I have to ask you."

"Yeah?"

"Will you marry me?"

Janus remained silent. "Wait, what?"

"I've been looking for a wife for the longest time. I think you and I would make a good team. Would you marry me?"

Janus shivered, remembering Zephy's scarred and macabre face. "No way." She said before she could reign herself in. "I mean... I hardly know you."

"Yeah. True." Zephy sighed. "Welp. I'll be on my way then. It was nice meeting you, Janus and Vespa. Take care."

With that, Zephy stumbled into the night, leaving Janus silent, unable to come up with any words.

And then she realized. "W-wait!" She called out after him. She heard his muffled footsteps stop. "Yeah?"

"You can't see, can you?"

"No. Not in the traditional sense, anyways. I can sense things using my abilities."

Janus didn't understand what what he meant, but she didn't care either way. "Then stay!" She pleaded. "Stay, please, Zephy, I'm begging you!"

"...or what?"

"Or... or... or I'll regret it for the rest of my life." Janus sobbed, tears flowing.

"Jeez. I can't believe you're crying. I can't believe I made you cry."

Janus wiped her tears away, a smiled now crossing her lips. "It's okay. I'm okay now," she said upon hearing his footsteps draw near.

"All right, babe." Zephy cooed reassuringly as he sat down on the ground next to Janus. "All right."
